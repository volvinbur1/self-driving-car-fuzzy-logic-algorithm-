# self-driving-car-fuzzy-logic-algorithm-
My first robotic project.
This one was created an year ago.

Here is a source code of robotic platform based on Raspberry PI. The main purpose of it is to avoid obstacles using the closest way. The script which control the robot is based on fuzzy logic algorithm. The input values for it are distance measuring maded by ultra sonic sensor HC-SR04. The output values are the way of riding and PWM duty.

I created a desktop software for easly comumnication with Raspberry too. It uses Wi-Fi connection and SSH protocol to transfer data.
